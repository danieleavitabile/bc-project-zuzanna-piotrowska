Abstract:
In this thesis, we compare the Monte Carlo and stochastic collocation methods that can be used to estimate mean and variance of quantities of interest. First, we look into an example problem to ensure thorough understanding of the methods as well as the ability to compare the results to analytical findings. We then move to a more complex framework - neural field model. We start by analysing its steady states and later we introduce a random parameter that defines if the solution converges to a localised spike in neural activity or to a zero steady state. After estimating the mean we look at its possible application in approximating the probability of seeing a one bump steady state as opposed to a trivial one. Finally, we study the error bounds. The results found in this paper can be a starting point for further research that can eventually contribute to a more accurate error quantification in medical studies.
